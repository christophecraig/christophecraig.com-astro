## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `pnpm astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |

## ðŸŽµ Spotify Integration

This blog includes a Spotify integration that displays your personal top tracks and recently played tracks on the homepage.

To enable the Spotify integration:

1. Create a Spotify Developer account and app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/
2. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret
3. Add them to your `.env` file:

```env
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

4. Update your Spotify app's redirect URI to match your deployment:
   - For local development: `http://localhost:4321/api/auth/spotify/callback`
   - For production: `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/spotify/callback`

5. Authenticate with Spotify by visiting `/api/auth/spotify` on your site
6. Grant permission for the app to read your top tracks and recently played tracks

See [SPOTIFY_SETUP.md](SPOTIFY_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions and [SPOTIFY_FIXES_SUMMARY.md](SPOTIFY_FIXES_SUMMARY.md) for recent fixes.
